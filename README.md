# Dun.Gen()

**Overview**:
Dun.Gen() is a procedurally generated fantasy story application. The existing generator applications using the D&D 5e API don't provide the user with a story to begin their quest. Dun.Gen() not only generates the elements required to start a quest, but most importanly provides the user with a quest in a story based format to begin their adventure.

**Authors**:
Robb Alexander, Chuck Altopiedi, Joshua McCluskey

**Version**: 1.0.0
