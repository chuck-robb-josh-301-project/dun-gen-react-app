The elder eyes ${this.state.currentHero.name}'s smoldering abode: "It seem we have both lost our ties to ${this.state.currentHero.villageName} this day." Taking stock of the chaos of the morning, ${this.state.currentHero.name} recalls the modest coloring on the clothing of several of the fallen among the drab of their fellows. "My remaining time was for my children, my remaining wealth for their children-to-be. If you can secure their justice, their inheritance will pay your way to a new home that is... more suitable for you." The elder reveals a solid case just large enough to still fit under an arm-- weathered but with faint filigree still showing, as well as an oddly marked disk small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. "Do you assent, ${this.state.currentHero.race}?"\n`}

Inaudible whispers and a series of arching hand gestures follow, until the seam of the case disappears from view, leaving uninterrupted patterns. The elder then hands over the objects.
